# Supabase free tier – player capacity estimate

## Plan limits (free tier)

- **Database size:** 500 MB per project (hard limit; read-only if exceeded).
- Storage (bucket) and egress have separate quotas; this estimate focuses on **database** as the main constraint for morgue data.

## Data model (what uses database space)

1. **`morgue_files`** – one row per uploaded morgue:
   - `raw_text` (TEXT) – full morgue file content (dominant share of DB size).
   - `filename`, `user_id`, `id`, `created_at` – small overhead.

2. **`parsed_morgues`** – one row per morgue (parsed fields):
   - ~20 columns (ids, character_name, species, background, xl, place, turns, duration, god, runes, etc.).
   - Indexes on `user_id`, `short_id`, etc. add some overhead.

3. **`user_stats`** – one row per user:
   - Aggregates (totals, win rate, streaks, fastest win, etc.) plus JSONB (e.g. species_stats, background_stats, god_stats).
   - Small compared to morgue data.

## Assumptions

- **200 morgue files per user** (as specified).
- **Average size of `raw_text` per morgue:** 25 KB (typical DCSS morgue with inventory, skills, message history). In practice, files often sit in a **15–40 KB** range; 25 KB is a middle estimate.
- **`parsed_morgues`:** ~0.5–1 KB per row including index overhead → use **~1 KB per morgue**.
- **`user_stats`:** **~5 KB per user** (one row with aggregates + JSONB).

## Per-user database size (200 morgues)

| Component        | Calculation     | Size    |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| morgue_files   | 200 × 25 KB     | 5.0 MB  |
| parsed_morgues | 200 × 1 KB      | 0.2 MB  |
| user_stats     | 1 × 5 KB        | 0.005 MB|
| **Total per user** |                | **~5.2 MB** |

## Estimated number of players

- **500 MB ÷ 5.2 MB ≈ 96 users** (with 200 morgues each at 25 KB average).

### Sensitivity to morgue size

| Avg morgue `raw_text` | Per user (200 morgues) | Players (500 MB) |
|----------------------|------------------------|------------------|
| 15 KB                | ~3.1 MB                | ~161             |
| 25 KB                | ~5.2 MB                | ~96              |
| 40 KB                | ~8.2 MB                | ~61              |

So a reasonable **planning range** is **about 60–160 players** at 200 morgues per user, depending on average morgue file size. Using **~25 KB** per file gives **~100 players** as a central estimate.

## Mixed scenario: 50% upload, 50% online sync (parsed-only for sync)

If **half of players** use **online server sync** and those morgues are **not** stored in full (only parsed data), storage per user drops sharply for that half.

**Current implementation note:** Today, online import does write full `raw_text` into `morgue_files` so the morgue browser and download work. The numbers below assume a “sync-only” mode where sync users have **no** `morgue_files` rows (only `parsed_morgues` + `user_stats`). That would require a code/schema change (e.g. optional `morgue_file_id`, no insert into `morgue_files` for sync).

### Per-user storage in the mixed scenario

| User type   | Share | morgue_files | parsed_morgues | user_stats | **Total per user** |
|------------|-------|--------------|----------------|------------|--------------------|
| Upload     | 50%   | 200 × 25 KB = 5.0 MB | 200 × 1 KB = 0.2 MB | ~5 KB | **~5.2 MB** |
| Sync-only  | 50%   | 0            | 200 × 1 KB = 0.2 MB | ~5 KB | **~0.2 MB**  |

**Weighted average per user:**  
0.5 × 5.2 + 0.5 × 0.2 = **2.7 MB per user**.

### Estimated number of players (50% sync-only)

- **500 MB ÷ 2.7 MB ≈ 185 users** (with 200 morgues each, 25 KB avg raw for upload users).

After reserving ~50–100 MB for auth and overhead: **~170–180 players** as a practical range.

So with half of players on sync (parsed-only), capacity is roughly **double** the all-upload case (~100 → ~180 users).

## Parsed data only (no saved morgues)

If we **remove `morgue_files` entirely** and keep only **parsed data** (`parsed_morgues` + `user_stats`), every user is effectively “parsed-only.” That implies:

- No raw morgue browser or “download morgue” from your DB (users could still view stats, charts, achievements; full morgue would need to come from elsewhere, e.g. fetched from the DCSS server on demand).
- Upload flow would parse on upload, insert into `parsed_morgues` only, and discard raw text (or not store it). Online sync already has the raw text in memory only; it would just stop writing to `morgue_files`.

### Per-user storage (parsed only, 200 morgues)

| Component        | Calculation     | Size    |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------|
| morgue_files   | 0               | 0       |
| parsed_morgues | 200 × 1 KB      | 0.2 MB  |
| user_stats     | 1 × 5 KB        | ~0.005 MB |
| **Total per user** |                | **~0.2 MB** |

### Estimated number of players (parsed only)

- **500 MB ÷ 0.2 MB ≈ 2,500 users** (with 200 morgues each).

After reserving ~50–100 MB for auth and overhead: **~2,000–2,200 players** as a practical range.

So with **no saved morgues**, capacity is about **20–25×** the all-upload case (~100 → ~2,000+ users). The tradeoff is losing in-app full morgue viewing/download unless you fetch from the game server on demand.

## Notes

- **Auth and system tables** (e.g. `auth.users`) use extra space; the above is for morgue-related data only. Leaving ~50–100 MB for auth and overhead is prudent.
- **Egress:** Free tier includes 5 GB/month; serving raw morgues and API responses will consume this. Sync-only users don’t need raw morgue served from your DB, so egress is lower for that segment.
- To support more users: reduce retention (e.g. cap morgues per user), add a sync-only path that skips `morgue_files`, or move large blobs out of the DB (e.g. store `raw_text` in Supabase Storage and keep only metadata in Postgres).
